AWS IoT Core connects devices with AWS services

AWS IoT Core is a cloud service that connects devices with AWS services and other devices through its device gateway and message broker.

Devices can publish messages that contain a current or requested state. Devices can subscribe to messages to be notified of changes to the current and requested states of other devices. The AWS IoT Core device gateway receives published messages and the message broker sends them to the devices that have subscribed to them.
